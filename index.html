                <h2 class="section-title">What lies beyond the tip of the "narrative" iceberg?</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Narrative frames is a type of media frames that use elements of narrativity to highlight some aspects of a complex issue and condense it into a simplified "story" that promotes a particular interpretation. These elements of storytelling, such as representing an issue through the lens of stakeholders and conflicts rather than direct description of the facts, make narrative frames a highly effective device, particularly in the context of contested issues such as climate change.</p>
                    
                    <p>Despite that, automatic framing analysis still mostly disregards narrative frames and conceptualizes frames in a topic-like fashion. Recent work in NLP has studied elements of narratives such as characters or events in news reporting, but these studies often lose the link to the core mechanism of framing, and do not allow to abstract away from particular events and characters in order to differentiate between contrasting narrative frames.</p>

                    <p>In our work, we dissect narratives into components which allow to link them to mechanisms of framing, on one hand, and help to understand, distinsguish, and model them. We show how:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Character roles</strong> (framing particular entities as heroes, villains, and victims) as well as <strong>focus</strong> on a particular character helps to resolve <strong>ambivalence</strong> of interpretation (which is necessary for framing to occur) and assign a particular <strong>moral evaluation</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Conflict and resolution</strong> represent causes and solutions to complex issues, which are core elements of their framing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cultural stories</strong> link to broader value systems, allowing the frames to evoke wider associations existing in the culture.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Let's take a deeper look at these components and see how they allow to uniquely represent narrative frames and distinguish between them.</p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <!-- Method -->
            <section id="method" class="section">
                <h2 class="section-title">Components of Narrative Framing</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
        
                    <h3>Characters</h3>
                    <p>Characters and their prototypical roles follow the simplified <strong>hero, villain, and victim (HVV)</strong> triad from the Narrative Policy Framework. By assigning entities to particular roles, we resolve issue ambivalence by conveying moral judgment. The framework distinguishes between main characters and other entities, using the <strong>single most central character</strong> fulfilling each role.</p>
                    
                    <p>To differentiate narratives, we also identify the <strong>focus</strong> on either hero, villain, or victim, resulting in "heroic", "blaming", and "victimizing" narrative frames respectively.</p>

                    <h3>Conflict and Resolution</h3>
                    <p>This component encapsulates the "plot" element and links to framing criteria that point to causes and resolutions. We conceptualize this as a four-way distinction where characters can:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Fuel Conflict:</strong> Perform actions that cause or exacerbate the issue</li>
                        <li><strong>Fuel Resolution:</strong> Perform actions that help resolve the issue</li>
                        <li><strong>Prevent Conflict:</strong> Oppose actions that cause or exacerbate the issue</li>
                        <li><strong>Prevent Resolution:</strong> Oppose actions that help resolve the issue</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Cultural Stories</h3>
                    <p>Cultural stories map narrative combinations to four larger interpretation schemata, defining the degree of external control and group belonging:</p>
                    <div class="formula">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Fatalist:</strong> People at mercy of external forces (natural disasters, fate)</li>
                            <li><strong>Hierarchical:</strong> Bound by social prescriptions and external control (government)</li>
                            <li><strong>Individualistic:</strong> Loose social ties, rejecting external control</li>
                            <li><strong>Egalitarian:</strong> Collective action, opposing external control</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>We have presented a rigorous formalization and taxonomy of components of narrative framing, synthesizing the Narrative Policy Framework with Entman's components of a frame. Our method allows inductive detection of narratives from political texts in terms of their character roles, focus, conflict, and underlying cultural story. Our key contributions include:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Theoretical Framework:</strong> A comprehensive formalization connecting elements of narrativity with fundamental aspects of framing</li>
                        <li><strong>Empirical Dataset:</strong> A high-quality annotated dataset of 100 climate change articles with reliable inter-annotator agreement</li>
                        <li><strong>LLM Evaluation:</strong> Systematic testing of multiple LLMs on narrative frame prediction tasks, revealing current limitations</li>
                        <li><strong>Cross-Domain Validation:</strong> Demonstration of framework generalizability from climate change to COVID-19 political discourse</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Our framework results in promising improvements for automatic narrative prediction with LLMs and lays a foundation for large-scale studies of narrative frame manifestation and effects. The structured approach to annotation achieves substantially higher agreement (63% vs 37%) compared to direct narrative labeling.</p>

                    <p>This work opens important research directions for computational analysis of narrative framing in political discourse, providing tools for understanding how complex issues are communicated and perceived across different political contexts.</p>
